{"name":"The-radio","tagline":"Web radio for human beeings","body":"## Why?\r\n![The result](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_front.JPG )\r\nMy wife wanted to have a new radio for the kitchen and threatened to buy some ~150 EUR CD/analog radio combo if I don't do anything about it. So I committed myself to come up with something that is 'infinitely better than a stupid CD thingy' for less then 100 EUR. How wrong I was to believe that one could simply buy a nice and easy to use web-radio that can play music from our NAS as well as tolerate the occasional ratatouille covered finger. The best I could find was a Logitech Squeezebox, but that is a million button haptic nightmare and frankly would not survive a week in out kitchen.  \r\n\r\nSo I set out to build a web-radio on basis of an old radio shell I bought ages ago on a flea market. It is a German Greatz vacuum tube radio built between 1953 and 1954. \r\n![Original radio](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_original.JPG ) \r\nThe radio was non-functional. On closer inspection, I found that some of the tubes where missing as well as some of the circuitry (no idea what the previous owner did to the poor thing). Looking at the picture, I still like the worn look of it. However, for it to be useful as a functional kitchen web radio, I had to bring it up to scratch. This process involved the few steps: refurbishing the outside, the installation of a new amp & speakers, a network capable mp3 player as well as some analog / digital interface to make use of all those awesome dials and buttons.\r\n\r\n## The shell\r\n\r\nI started off by removing the glued on brass brass strips that frame the speaker compartment. I then carefully removed the varnish with fine sand paper. Next, I stained the raw wood in a nice dark brown color. After some consideration I settled on shellac for the coating. I read quite a bit about how to do this (takes a lot of practice and time if you want to get it right and aim for an absolutely smooth piano like surface). I went for the relatively easy to do mate finish option.  To do this, you simply brush on a fine layer of shellac, let it dry for 12ish hours and sand it down with very fine sand paper. Repeat the process 4-5 times. The shellac leaves have to be dissolved in pure ethanol alcohol for 24h before use. Only use very small amounts of shellac for each coating otherwise you will end up having a bumpy surface that you have to sand down later (pain). The result is acceptable for my purpose however far from a piano like surface you could achieve with more patience.\r\n\r\nRepairing the front fabric was more tricky than I thought ... my wife tried to find a similar fabric to the original one but no avail. There is an old lady in Holland that will hand weave any [radio fabric](http://www.corrienmaas.nl/Engels/hoofdframe.htm) you like, but that is a bit off-budget. I finally settled on a Fender Wheat guitar amp 'grill cloth' - not as nice as the original, but at least the kids will have a hard time poking holes in it. I also replaced the MDF-board that held the original speaker and glued the new 'grill cloth' to it with transparent wood glue.\r\n\r\nFinally I thoroughly cleaned all the buttons and dials with a mild soap mixture. Before glueing the brass strips back on I cleaned them with a salt and vinegar mixture. Unfortunately these strips only have a very fine layer of brass that was severely damaged in the first place. Although I managed to remove most of the stains it only made the damages in the surface more visible. I may replace these strips one day if I have the right tools to cut very odd angles.\r\n\r\n## The amp & speakers\r\n\r\nI would have loved to use a small tube amp for this project but I could not find anything that sounds acceptable and fits within the budget. Instead, I went down the chip amp route. I own a Logitech X 230 / sub-woofer combo, which sound amazing for the price, but it did not fit into the case. So I downsized a bit and settled on a pair of Logitech X-140 PC speakers in the hope they would sound nice too. Unfortunately that was not the case. To my surprise, I discovered that there is only one active speaker per loudspeaker although the loudspeaker superficially looks like it has two. The second speaker turned out to be the passive membrane pictured below.\r\n![Original radio](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_logitech_speaker.JPG ) \r\nI want to believe that this is all justified and that Logitech's clever loudspeaker design + passive membrane leads to a superb sound reproduction but instead I felt a bit ripped off. Fortunately, I discovered that the guy who tortured the poor tube radio to death also replaced the stock speaker with a rather modern Visaton wide band speaker. A match made in heaven. I simply soldered the wide band speaker in parallel to one of the small Logitech speakers and moved it a bit off center to preserve the stereo effect. The sound is pretty decent now. However, the lesson I learned here is to invest a bit more in amps and speakers - I think 10 Euros more would have made a big difference.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem I encountered was a lot of static noise and humming. This was probably noise being picked up from the switched mode power supplies operating in close proximity to the amp (Logitech actually circumvents this problem by placing the power supply in one loudspeaker and the amp in the other). To get around this problem, I went to the supermarket and got a tin box (yummy chocolates) that could house the amp and act as a shield - this completely solved the noise issue. I also screwed the amp's heat sink to the lid of the tin so it would not overheat. In practice the amp does not even get hand warm now.    \r\n\r\n## Network MP3 player \r\n\r\nMy fist idea of implementing the player was using an Edimax 6200n wifi router with OpenWRT that mounts our NAS via Samba, runs the an MPD server and outputs audio via a USB soundcard. This did not work out so well for several reasons. First of all, current trunk versions of OpenWRT have [broken network functionality](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/edimax/3g-6200n) which essentially leaves the router inaccessible from the outside. After some reading of bug reports and patching the sources, I managed to compile a working image. The next problem was that I was not able to get two USB devices (USB sound dongle &amp; Arduino) in a conjunction with a USB hub to work. So I took the plunge and soldered a serial-cable to the PCB of the Edimax router and connected the Arduino (see next section) the old fashioned way. That left me with only one usb device (audio) which worked reasonably well. What finally killed the router idea was the severe flash memory limitation of 4MB. I was unable to fit Openwrt with USB-audio support, MPD and Samba file system modules within that space. It is probably possibly but I was pretty fed up at that point. I briefly experimented with network mounted root but then gave up (root on a USB stick did not work either since I would have had to use a hub again).\r\n\r\nSo instead I chose a RasperryPI model A for the network audio player. I chose the A model over model B since it is cheaper and I only need one usb port (wifi); serial and audio are on board. So the setup now involved the PI, a 4GB class 10 SD-Card, an Edimax EW-7811UN wifi dongle and a simple phone charger as the power supply. In the beginning I used Arch Linux, since I was intrigued by the promise of very short boot times. Unfortunately, I had to spend a lot of time to get used to their systemd service manager. What killed Arch for me in the end was the buggy serial kernel driver in the stock arch distro for Raspberry PI. I experienced data loss and random serial device lockups. I did not investigate this any further since I finally wanted to get something to work. So I simply changed to Raspbian. Here the same code that kept me cursing for days worked flawlessly.\r\n\r\n## Interfacing the controls\r\n\r\nI wanted to preserve the feeling of the radio as much as I can. This meant that all of the original functionality would have to be re-implemented. This involved reading the analog values of all potentiometers (volume, bass, treble), reading the state of the selector switches as well as reading the station selector dial. All this is performed by an Arduino that does some additional averaging and pushes the sampled values to the PI via the serial interface. Interfacing the potentiometers was fairly standard, I connected the ends to GND and +5V and the the wiper pins to an analog inputs of the Arduino. I also read the state of the switches via an analog input in order to save IO pins. This is performed by connecting resistors of different values to the switches and measuring the voltage drop over an additional resistor. Although the Arduino has a 10bit analog digital converter, the actually usable resolution is more like 6bits. \r\nThis is due to two reasons: for one, potentiometers are a bit noisy and neither the potentiometers nor my cabling are shielded, hence the Arduino ADC will naturally see some noise. This is less problematic and can easily be filtered out with some simple averaging. What really reduced the resolution radically was the old school construction of the spring loaded selector switch. On pressing one of the buttons, you will hear a massive 'clack!' that is shaking the whole radio and is physically moving the potentiometers. I takes up to a second for all the values to stop dancing about. In the end, I scaled the value range of the potentiometers to 0-100 which is the default format for MPD and Alsa volume settings.\r\nReading the station selector dial was a whole other story. I played with the idea of feeding some AC current into the variable capacitor that was connected to the selector dial via a system of pulleys. The capacitance could than, in theory, be measured as the voltage drop over the capacitor. The disadvantage of this approach was the limited range of the selector dial: it would have a natural 'end' where the capacitor is either fully open or fully closed. This concept is somehow incompatible with a list of web radio stations of arbitrary length. So I had to come up with another solution that implements an 'endless' selector dial.\r\nMy first approach reuse the original pulley system and replace the the capacitor with an analog ball mouse connected to the Arduino thanks to the superb Arduino PS/2 library.\r\n![Original radio](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_ball_mouse.JPG ) \r\nThis worked reasonably well, however, I ran into a very practical problem: how does one produce an endless cord without a knot? The knot just would just not go around the tiny spindle of the PS/2 mouse. I know the principle of splicing from my sailing lessons however this cord is like 0.5mm thick! Instead of investigating the art of bumpless knots any further, I opted for a different solution.\r\nThe shaft of the station selector dial connects to a massive metal cast disk located in the base of the radio. I can only assume that this disk is intended to give the dial some additional inertia in order make it feel more classy (are you reading this Logitech Squeezebox dudes - metal inertia disk!). How awesome. This metal disk gave me an idea. Maybe I could use an optical mouse to pick up the the disk's movement and get around the knot issue altogether. Luckily, I found an old optical PS/2 mouse in my stash. I cut down the mouse case until I only had the mouse base with PCB, optical sensor and optics left. I then attached a piece of sheet metal to the radio's chassis and the mouse and positioned the sensor over metal disk so it is aligned with the sensors y-axis. \r\n![Original radio](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_station_dial.JPG ) \r\nSince I could simply reuse my code from the ball mouse experiment, I had a working digital selector dial pickup within moments. After some happy station dialing I asked myself what else I could use the mouse for. It had a few switches and another optical sensor axis left unused. The X-axis of the mouse sensor would correspond to moving the selector dial in and out which would be a .... push button! So all I had to do was to introduce some X-axis wiggle into the selector dial. This was easily done by cutting some spacers to size that held the shaft in place. I also drilled a small hole in the end of the shaft and attached a peg spring to it so it would bounce back. A few extra lines of code and I had a working pressure sensitive optical push button (TM). Probably the most awesome thing I will ever invent. A later noticed that the uneven silver surface of the disk confused the optical mouse sensor from time to time. This was easily fixed by putting some electrical tape around it. Now, if there is a change in any value, the analog values together with the digital values from the mouse are pushed to the RaspberryPI via the serial interface. This completes the interfacing part.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Putting it all together</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now I had an amp, speakers and a serial interface that would inform me about user inputs. Now I connected the serial interface of the Arduino to the correct serial GPIO pins on the Rapsberry PI. I also chose to power the Arduino from the PI. On the raspberry PI I now installed the MPD and mounted my NAS via Smaba/CIFS. I now wrote a pythen script (actually my first attempt at Python) that does the follwing. First the script connects to the MPD via the python-mpd library. This took a bit more effort than I thought since the MPD likes to drop the connection rather frequently. This required some reconnection code. On startup, the script listens on the serial interface and reacts to any value changes: Volume is set via python-mpd, band selector switches switch between several pre-defined playlist and base / treble are set via an alsa mixer shell command. In my case VHF/UKW is web radio, MW. are kids songs, etc. I later disabled the base / treble because they annoyed me. For the kids songs I simply execute a next/previous command every time the station selector is turned a pre-defined amount. My pressure sensitive optical push button (TM) is currently as a pause/play button but may serve a different purpose in the future. \r\n![Functional but not cleaned up](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_station_vol.JPG )\r\nFor playing web-radio, however, I took a somewhat different approach that to simply executing a next/previous command. Maybe I am sentimental, but I really like the haptics of analog radios. One does not simply push a button and the next perfectly tuned station pops up but one has to actually interact with the radio. This is nice, especially with such a his little feeling of accomplishment if one manages to tune into a weak station by repeatedly adjusting the station selector by minuscule amounts is just something that is lost by digital push buttons. Fortunately, this feeling can be brought back with a few lines of code. What is does is It simply reduces the volume if the dial is not 'tuned' to an imaginary station. I also considered adding a noise floor between stations but I did not have to. The Raspberry PI audio driver is known to have a few audio issues (e.g. the plop issue). Another issue seems to be that if the volume is reduced to 0, the PI is still sending a faint, distorted signal to the audio interface. My amp picks up on this and produces something that sounds a bit like static - perfect. Another advantage of heaving a dead-zone of zero volume between web radio stations is that the buffering delay is not noticeable, it appears like the stations are just all there. \r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this project is that one does not seek perfection but a certain degree of authenticity. For this reason I don't really mind the 45 seconds boot time of the PI since it could corresponds to the tube warm up time of the original radio.\r\n![Functional but not cleaned up](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_back.JPG \"Functional but not cleaned up\")\r\nAfter I finishes the functional part, I mounted everything on a plywood board that I cut to size and mounted on the original radio chassis. The base and volume dial of the new amp can now be accessed from the back. I also screwed a small multi-plug onto the plywood board that feeds the amp and the Raspberry PI PSU. The multi-plug is connected to the original mains switch of the radio that in turn is connected to the power lead. All done.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
