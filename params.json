{"name":"The-radio","tagline":"Web radio for homan beeings","body":"## Why?\r\n![The result](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_front.JPG )\r\nMy wife wanted to have a new radio for the kitchen and threatened to buy some ~150 EUR CD/analog radio combo if I don't do anything about it. So I committed myself to come up with something that is 'infinitely better than the CD thing' for less then 100 EUR. How wrong I was to believe that one could simply buy a nice and easy to operate web-radio (think 3 year olds) that can play music from our NAS as well as tolerate the occasional ratatouille covered finger. The best I could find slightly outside of the 100 EUR budget was a Logitech Squeezebox but that has a million buttons and frankly would not survive a week in out kitchen. \r\n\r\nSo I set out to build a web-radio on basis of an old radio shell I bought ages ago on a flea market. It is a German Greatz vacuum tube radio built between 1953 and 1954. \r\n![Original radio](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_original.JPG ) \r\nThe radio was non-functional when I bought and on closer inspection, I found that some tubes where missing as well as some of the circuitry (no idea what the previous owner did to the poor thing). It still like the worn look of it however to be useful as a functional kitchen web radio I had to bring it up to scratch. This process involved the refurbishing of the outside, the installation of a new amp, an network capable mp3 player as well as some analog / digital interface to make use of all those awesome dials. \r\n\r\n## The outside\r\n\r\nI removed the varnish with fine sand paper and stained the raw wood in a dark brown color. After some consideration I settled on shellac for the coating. I read quite a bit about how to do this (takes a lot of practice and time if you want to get it right and aim for an absolutely smooth surface). I went for the the relatively easy to do mate finish option which is relatively simple to achieve using a paintbrush. The shellac leaves are dissolved in pure ethanol alcohol for 24h before use. Only use very small amounts between coatings otherwise you will end up having bumps that you have to sand down later (pain). Also carefully sand down between coatings. I used about 4-5 coatings and the result is acceptable for my purpose however far from a piano like surface. \r\n\r\nRepairing the front fabric was more tricky than I thought ... my wife tried to find a similar fabric to the original one but no avail. There is an old lady in Holland that will hand weave any [radio fabric](http://www.corrienmaas.nl/Engels/hoofdframe.htm) you like, but that is a bit off-budget. I finally settled on a Fender Wheat guitar amp \"grill cloth\" - not as nice as the original, but at least the kids will have a hard time poking holes in it.\r\n\r\nI also thoroughly cleaned all the buttons and dials with a mild soap mixture. Before coating I also took of the messing strips and tried to clean them with a salt and vinegar mixture. Unfortunately these strips only have a very fine layer of brass that was severely damaged in the first place. So I managed to remove all the stains however now the damaged surface is even more visible. I might replace these strips one day if I have the right tools to cut very odd angles.\r\n\r\n## The amp\r\nI would have loved to use a small tube amp for this project but I could not find anything that sounds acceptable and fits withing the budget. Instead I settled for a pair of Logitech X-140 PC speakers. I also own a Logitech X 230 / sub-woofer combo which sounds very good for the price which made me believe that the X-140 would do the same. Unfortunately that was not really the case. To my surprise I discovered only one active speaker per speakerbox although the speakerbox superficially looks like it has two. The send speaker turned out to be passive membrane pictured below\r\n![Original radio](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_speaker.JPG ) \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want from a radio is rather modest, it should play music from our NAS and the web and should be easy to operate even if you are coated in a bit of sugar, flour \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n![Functional but not cleaned up](https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_back.JPG \"Functional but not cleaned up\")\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
