        <h2>Why?</h2>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/2dom/the-radio/master/pics/small_front.JPG" alt="The result">
My wife wanted to have a new radio for the kitchen and threatened to buy some ~150 EUR CD/analog radio combo if I don't do anything about it. So I committed myself to come up with something that is 'infinitely better than the CD thing' for less then 100 EUR. How wrong I was to believe that one could simply buy a nice and easy to operate web-radio (think 3 year olds) that can play music from our NAS as well as tolerate the occasional ratatouille covered finger. The best I could find slightly outside of the 100 EUR budget was a Logitech Squeezebox but that has a million buttons and frankly would not survive a week in out kitchen. </p>

<p>So I set out to build a web-radio on basis of an old radio shell I bought ages ago on a flea market. It is a German Greatz vacuum tube radio built between 1953 and 1954.

The radio was barely dysfunctional when I bought and on closer inspection I found that some tubes where missing as well as some of the circuitry (no idea what the previous owner did to the poor thing). It still like the worn look of it however to be useful as a functional kitchen radio I had to bring it up to scratch. This process involved the refurbishing of the outside, the installation of a new amp, an network capable mp3 player as well as some analog / digital interface to male use of all those awesome dials. </p>

<h2>The outside</h2>

<p>I removed the varnish with fine sand paper and stained the raw wood in a dark brown color. I then re-coated with shellac. I read quite a bit about how to do this (takes a lifetime of practice if you want to do it right and get an absolutely flat surface) and went for the the relatively easy to do mate finish simply brush on option. Only use very small amounts between coatings otherwise you will have bumps that you have to sand down later (pain). Also carefully sand down between coatings. </p>

<p>Repairing the front fabric was more tricky than I thought ... my wife tried to find a similar fabric that was on the original radio but no avail. There is an old lady in Holland that will hand weave any <a href="http://www.corrienmaas.nl/Engels/hoofdframe.htm">radio fabric</a> you like but that is a bit off-budget. I finally settled on a Fender Wheat amp "grill cloth" - not as nice as the original, but at least the kids will have a hard time to poke a hole in it.</p>

<p>What I want from a radio is rather modest, it should play music from our NAS and the web and should be easy to operate even if you are coated in a bit of sugar, flour </p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
